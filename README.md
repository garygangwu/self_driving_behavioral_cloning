# Behavioral Cloning for Self-Driving Cars

The goal of this project is to train a convolutional neural network to map the front-facing camera directly to the steering commands. With the training model, the system can drive a car autonomously around test tracks in the Udacity's driving simulator.

Here are two youtube videos that the self cars ran under two anmiated roads from the simulation tool
